ceylon.ast
==========

`ceylon.ast` will be a Ceylon module that allows you to construct a Ceylon Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in your program.
You can then feed this AST into other modules, like the compiler to compile it or the [`ceylon.formatter`](https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/ceylon.formatter) to write it as code (code generation).

This is the Google Summer of Code 2014 project of Lucas Werkmeister (@lucaswerkmeister); see [the mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ceylon-dev/_Uo5P2AgxmA)
or the [project](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/lucaswerkmeister/5741031244955648).
Contributions are of course welcome!
