"`this`, `super`, `outer` and `package` are *self reference expressions*.
 The type of these expressions depends on the context in which they appear.
 
 While these expressions are interesting from a typing perspective,
 their AST nodes are actually really boring and completely stateless.

 [[outerInstance]] and [[packageInstance]] instead of creating new instances every time."
