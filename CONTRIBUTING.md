Coding style
------------
All code *should* be formatted with the [`ceylon.formatter`](https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/ceylon.formatter);
however, as no version of that has been released yet, we won’t enforce this rule for a while :)

We’ll most likely keep the default settings;
if not, we’ll put the settings in the Ceylon config file, where the formatter will [pick them up automatically](https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/ceylon.formatter/issues/32), so you don’t need to worry about that.
